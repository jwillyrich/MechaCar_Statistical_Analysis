Part 1: Step 5. Perform linear regression using the lm() function. In the lm() function, pass in all six variables (i.e., columns), and add the dataframe you created in Step 4 as the data parameter.

Call:
lm(formula = mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + 
    ground_clearance + AWD, data = MechaCar_MPG)

Coefficients:
     (Intercept)    vehicle_length    vehicle_weight     spoiler_angle  ground_clearance               AWD  
      -1.040e+02         6.267e+00         1.245e-03         6.877e-02         3.546e+00        -3.411e+00
